Netflix Immersive
=================

A user script that aims to make Netflix viewing more immersive. In particular,
it ensures end credits are given the same importance as movies.

* End credits are no longer minimised, and continue playing in the full browser
  frame
* The “Watch Credits”, “Skip Intro”, “Skip Recap”, and “Next Episode” buttons
  are hidden
* The age rating is hidden


## Design Goals

* Videos should play in the full browser frame and in their entirety, with no
  automatic skipping of intros, credits, or other sections
* User interface elements must be hidden during playback, unless shown in
  response to user interaction


## Install
Open the [raw script][1] and click “Install” in the resulting dialog. A [more
detailed explanation][2] is available on the Greasemonkey wiki.
